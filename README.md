## About

A Pokédex React app that displays information about Pokémon using the [PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/). Project was created to learn more about React, TypeScript and frontend development. There is a lot of room for improvement and I will work on it sometime in the future.

Generated the project using Vite and React with TypeScript template.
